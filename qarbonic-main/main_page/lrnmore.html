                    <h1>What is carbon offsetting?</h1>
                    <h3>Carbon offsetting occurs when a polluting company buys a carbon credit
                        from companies with a negative carbon footprint to make up for the
                        greenhouse gas it has emitted. Offsetting, if done properly, can help channel
                        funds to conservation and sustainable development projects that will reduce
                        emissions, giving companies time to work towards zero emissions.
                        A carbon credit is a kind of tradable permit that, per United Nations
                        standards, equals one tonne of carbon dioxide removed, reduced, or
                        sequestered from the atmosphere. Carbon allowances or caps, meanwhile,
                        are determined by countries or governments according to their emission
                        reduction targets which industries are required to follow.</h3>

                    <h1>What is Qarbonic?</h1>
                    <h3>Qarbonic is a Decentralized Application (DApp) that enables the P2P trade of
                        carbon credits (carbon offsets) between companies.
                        We provide a platform for companies to purchase carbon credits digitally that
                        translate to government issued carbon credits which they can use to offset
                        their emissions and stay carbon neutral or to reach their government-set
                        emission caps.
                        We also provide a platform for NGOs to sell their carbon credits for money to
                        earn funding for their operations to conserve the environment.</h3>
